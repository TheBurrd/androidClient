    <string name="about_us">Hello!\n\nWe are Team DGAF, a group of ten students from UC San Diego making
    a bold foray into the world of mobile app development.  Happy Hour began as a project for our Software Engineering
    course.  We sought to create an app that would enable student\'s to find the best value for food and
    drinks in their local area.  Our team consists of Brenton Ang, Sherman Cheung, Adam Dorwat, Xu(Ken) He,
    Soham Jatakia, Chloe Lopez, David Liberman, Trent Miller, Anjali Patel, and Andrew Walters.  We are very
    proud to bring you this app and wish you the best of luck in your gastronomic endeavors.  Happy Happy Hour!</string>
